## Getting to know the datasets

```{R}
# Load datasets
DS <- read.csv("cookie_cats_ABtest.csv")
nrow(DS)
ncol(DS)
summary(DS)

```

```{R}
# Load datasets
PR <- read.csv("cookie_cats_purch.csv")
nrow(PR)
ncol(PR)
summary(PR)


```

# 2. Preprocessing
## 2.1 Preprocessing dataset "Cookie Cats AB Testing"

```{R}
unique(DS$version)
unique(DS$sum_gamerounds)
unique(DS$retention_1) #Doing this we can search inconsistencies, like there are FALSE " false" and TRUE " true " variables when it should only be FALSE and TRUE

DS$retention_1[DS$retention_1 == "false "] = FALSE #Changing that "false " into FALSE so we have only one FALSE value
DS$retention_1[DS$retention_1 == "  true "] = TRUE #Changing that " true " into TRUE so we have only one TRUE value

unique(DS$retention_1) #to check if we change the values correctly.
DS$retention_1 = as.logical(DS$retention_1) #now our values in retention_1 are logical values. Before doing that they where strings.
unique(DS$retention_1) #to check if we change the values correctly again.
unique(DS$retention_7) 

```

## 2.2 Preprocessing dataset "Cookie Cats Purchases"

```{R}
#Check the data set for inconsistencies on the values
unique(PR$id)
unique(PR$purch)

#Change all negatives values to positives values
PR$purch <- gsub("-", "", PR$purch)

#Remove all NA values in the dataset
PR <- na.omit(PR)

#Check again to be sure there are no more inconsistencies
unique(PR$id)
unique(PR$purch)

```

# 3. Descriptive analytics
## 3.1 Dataset “Cookie Cats AB Testing”

### 3.1.1 Users that downloaded the game
```{R}
totalUserAmmount <- length(DS$userid)
totalUserAmmount
```

### 3.1.2 Distribution of users in groups
```{R}
#Check the ammount of users for each group of the A/B test
g30_UserAmmount <- length(DS$userid[DS$version == "gate_30"])
g40_UserAmmount <- length(DS$userid[DS$version == "gate_40"])

#Verify that the sum of the ammount of users per group is equal to the totalilty of users
g30_UserAmmount + g40_UserAmmount == totalUserAmmount

g30_Percentile <- (g30_UserAmmount / totalUserAmmount) * 100
g30_Percentile

g40_Percentile <- (g40_UserAmmount / totalUserAmmount) * 100
g40_Percentile

#There's a slightly higher ammount of users in gate40 than in gate30, precisely an 0.87% more
(g40_Percentile - g30_Percentile) 

#We draw a pie chart to see that difference more clearly
pie(c(g30_UserAmmount, g40_UserAmmount),  c("Gate 30", "Gate 40"))


```

### 3.1.3 Game rounds

What is the distribution of game rounds in the players’ population? 

```{R}
#No se que coi va aqui, he estat provant coses, pero xDD
y = pnorm(DS$sum_gamerounds, mean(DS$sum_gamerounds), sd(DS$sum_gamerounds))

plot(DS$sum_gamerounds, y)

barplot(DS$sum_gamerounds, y)

hist(DS$sum_gamerounds, y)




```

And among the users of version A and version B of the game separately?

```{R}
#NPI parte 2
barplot()

```

### 3.1.4 Retention 

What is the value of retention at day 1? (percentage of users that are still active the day after installation).

```{R}
# ---------- RETENTION 1 ----------
#Percentage of users with version gate_30 that are still active the day after installation (among all players with gate_30)
g30Ret1 = length(DS$version[DS$version == "gate_30" & DS$retention_1 == TRUE])
g30Ret1Percentage = (g30Ret1/ g30_UserAmmount) * 100
g30Ret1Percentage

#Percentage of users with version gate_40 that are still active the day after installation (among all players with gate_40)
g40Ret1 = length(DS$version[DS$version == "gate_40" & DS$retention_1 == TRUE])
g40Ret1Percentage = (g40Ret1/ g40_UserAmmount) * 100
g40Ret1Percentage

#There's a slighlty higher retention_1 of users in gate_30 than in gate_40
(g30Ret1Percentage - g40Ret1Percentage)

```

What is the value of retention at day 7? (percentage of users that are still active after one week of installation).

```{R}
# ---------- RETENTION 7 ----------
#Percentage of users with version gate_30 that are still active after one week of installation (among all players with gate_30)
g30Ret7 = length(DS$version[DS$version == "gate_30" & DS$retention_7 == TRUE])
g30Ret7Percentage = (g30Ret7/ g30_UserAmmount) * 100
g30Ret7Percentage

#Percentage of users with version gate_40 that are still active after one week of installation (among all players with gate_40)
g40Ret7 = length(DS$version[DS$version == "gate_40" & DS$retention_7 == TRUE])
g40Ret7Percentage = (g40Ret7/ g40_UserAmmount) * 100
g40Ret7Percentage

#There's a slighlty higher retention_1 of users in gate_30 than in gate_40
(g30Ret7Percentage - g40Ret7Percentage)

```


### 3.1.5 Are there non-playing users?

```{R}
#To know if there are nonplayers, we have to look sum_gamerounds. If they've played  0 rounds, it means they didn't play the game.
#Searching for non players (sum_gamerounds = 0)
nonPlayersAmmount = length(DS$sum_gamerounds[DS$sum_gamerounds == 0])
nonPlayersAmmount

#NonPlayers in percentage
nonPlayersPercentage = (nonPlayersAmmount / totalUserAmmount) * 100
nonPlayersPercentage

#Piechart
names = c("Players", "Non Players")
variables = c(totalUserAmmount, nonPlayersAmmount)

pie(variables, names)
```


## 3.2 Dataset “Cookie Cats Purchases”

# 4. Monetization metrics 

```{R}
#ARPU - Average Revenue Per User 
#Fixing purch to sum up all the purchases. To do that, we split our string purch to use only the numbers and get rid of EUR.
purchFixed = strsplit(PR$purch, split = "EUR")
newPurchFixed = as.vector(unlist(purchFixed))
newPurchFixed = as.numeric(newPurchFixed)

allPurch = sum(newPurchFixed)

#Now we compute our ARPU
arpu = allPurch / totalUserAmmount
arpu

#ARRPU - Average Revenue Per Paying User
#computing the number of players who pay
payingUsers = length(unique(PR$id))
arrpu = allPurch / payingUsers
arrpu

#Conversion Rate
conversionRate = payingUsers/totalUserAmmount
conversionRate

conversionRate * 100
```

# 5. A/B Testing
```{R}





```
